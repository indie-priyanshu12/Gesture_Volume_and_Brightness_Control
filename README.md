#Gesture-Controlled Volume and Brightness

This Python program allows you to control your computer's volume and brightness using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the program tracks the distance between specific fingers to adjust settings seamlessly:

Volume Control: Adjust the volume by changing the distance between your thumb and index finger.
Brightness Control: Adjust the brightness by changing the distance between your thumb and middle finger.

Features

Real-Time Tracking: The program uses real-time hand tracking to detect finger positions and calculate distances.
Smooth Adjustments: Volume and brightness levels change smoothly in response to your gestures.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive interface that provides visual feedback on the current volume and brightness levels.

Dependencies

OpenCV
Mediapipe
Numpy
Pycaw (for volume control on Windows)
ScreenBright (or equivalent library for brightness control)

Project Background

This project was developed as part of a first-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) course in college. It showcases the practical application of computer vision and human-computer interaction principles.
