# Gesture-Controlled Volume and Brightness

This Python program allows you to control your computer's volume and brightness using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the program tracks the distance between specific fingers to adjust settings seamlessly.

## Features

- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume by changing the distance between your thumb and index finger.
- **Brightness Control**: Adjust the brightness by changing the distance between your thumb and middle finger.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: The program uses real-time hand tracking to detect finger positions and calculate distances.
- **Smooth Adjustments**: Volume and brightness levels change smoothly in response to your gestures.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface provides visual feedback on the current volume and brightness levels.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- `OpenCV`
- `Mediapipe`
- `Numpy`
- `Pycaw` (for volume control on Windows)
- `ScreenBright` (or an equivalent library for brightness control)



## You can install these dependencies with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw screen_bright
```


## Project Background

This project was developed as part of a first-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) course in college. It showcases the practical application of computer vision and human-computer interaction principles. By using hand gestures to adjust basic computer settings, the project explores intuitive and non-traditional user interfaces.
