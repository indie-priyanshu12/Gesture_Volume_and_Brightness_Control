# Gesture_Volume_and_Brightness_Control
This Python program, a first-year CSE project, lets you control your computer's volume and brightness through hand gestures. Using real-time hand tracking, it adjusts volume with the thumb-index finger distance and brightness with the thumb-middle finger distance. download the repo, install dependencies, and run the main script to start.
